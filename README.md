Hi, I’m a software engineer with over ten years of experience in Java and Python. I enjoy tackling challenging problems by writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that have real impact. During the day, I design microservices and data pipelines. Outside of work, I’m usually stargazing or exploring new tech and science topics — I love diving deep into whatever catches my interest.

I believe in learning by doing, and I’m comfortable with the occasional broken build if it means gaining a better understanding. I also enjoy sharing what I learn and collaborating with others who are curious about tech and the universe.
