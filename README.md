## Software Engineer | Space Enthusiast | Maker

Hi, I’m a software engineer with over ten years of experience in Java and Python. I enjoy tackling challenging problems by writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that have real impact. During the day, I design microservices and data pipelines. Outside of work, I’m usually stargazing or exploring new tech and science topics — I love diving deep into whatever catches my interest.

Space has fascinated me since I was a kid, and I try to bring that passion into my projects whenever I can. When I’m not coding or reading about black holes, I’m often in my workshop working with 3D printers — making practical stuff or models inspired by the cosmos. I find hands-on building helps me think more creatively as a developer.

I believe in learning by doing, and I’m comfortable with the occasional broken build if it means gaining a better understanding. I also enjoy sharing what I learn and collaborating with others who are curious about tech and the universe.
