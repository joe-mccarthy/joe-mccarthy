# Hello, I'm Joseph McCarthy üëã

## Software Engineer | Space Enthusiast | Maker

Software engineer focused on Java and Python development, working to solve interesting problems through clean code. I enjoy learning about space-related technologies and applying this knowledge in my projects. In my free time, I experiment with 3D printing and design - creating practical solutions and sometimes just fun objects. I believe in continuous learning through experimentation, and I'm not afraid of the occasional broken build that leads to better understanding.
