## Software Engineer | Space Enthusiast | Maker

Hi, I‚Äôm a software engineer with over ten years of experience in Java and Python. I enjoy tackling challenging problems by writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that have real impact. During the day, I design microservices and data pipelines. Outside of work, I‚Äôm usually stargazing or exploring new tech and science topics ‚Äî I love diving deep into whatever catches my interest.

Space has fascinated me since I was a kid, and I try to bring that passion into my projects whenever I can. When I‚Äôm not coding or reading about black holes, I‚Äôm often in my workshop working with 3D printers ‚Äî making practical stuff or models inspired by the cosmos. I find hands-on building helps me think more creatively as a developer.

I believe in learning by doing, and I‚Äôm comfortable with the occasional broken build if it means gaining a better understanding. I also enjoy sharing what I learn and collaborating with others who are curious about tech and the universe.
